# README

- Run this with Ruby 2.4.1 for that Rails 5 goodness
- rake db:populate does the db drop and migirations, plus it populates the database with all the teams and some of their pictures
- We technically have the team members and advisor for each team if we wanna do anything with that

TBD:
- Add an awards page
- Make it responsive
